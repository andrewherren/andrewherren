### Hi there, I'm Drew ðŸ‘‹

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Texas at Austin's [Salem Center for Policy](https://salemcenter.org). I completed my PhD in Statistics at Arizona State University in May 2023, working with [Richard Hahn](https://math.la.asu.edu/~prhahn/). 
My research interests include:

* Machine learning / feature selection for causal inference
* Bayesian nonparametrics (particularly, tree and partition-based methods)
* Model interpretability

You can learn more about my research and other projects on [my personal website](https://andrewherren.github.io).
